**Jumpstart your [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) development with this comprehensive TypeScript Template for building autonomous agents, servers, and clients.**

This template provides a solid, beginner-friendly foundation for building all components of the MCP ecosystem, adhering to the **MCP 2025-03-26 specification**. It includes a powerful agent framework, a fully-featured server, a robust client, production-ready utilities, and clear documentation to get you up and running quickly.

## 🏛️ Three-Part Architecture

This template is organized into three primary, interconnected components:

1.  **🤖 Agent (`src/agent/`)**: An autonomous agent framework. The agent can connect to multiple MCP servers, discover their tools, and use them to accomplish complex tasks based on a user's prompt. Use this as a starting point for your agents.
2.  **🔌 MCP Server (`src/mcp-server/`)**: An extensible MCP server that can host custom tools and resources, making them available to agents and other clients.
3.  **💻 MCP Client (`src/mcp-client/`)**: A robust client for connecting to and interacting with any MCP-compliant server. The agent uses this client to communicate with the outside world.

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cyanheads/mcp-ts-template.git
cd mcp-ts-template
npm install
```

### 2. Build the Project

```bash
npm run build
# Or use 'npm run rebuild' for a clean install
```

### 3. Running the Components

#### Running the MCP Server

You can run the included MCP server to make its tools available.

- **Via Stdio (Default):**
  ```bash
  npm run start:server
  ```
- **Via Streamable HTTP:**
  ```bash
  npm run start:server:http
  ```

#### Running the Agent

The agent can be run from the command line to perform tasks. It will automatically connect to the servers defined in `src/mcp-client/client-config/mcp-config.json`. If running the agent, you must have the MCP config set up correctly and your openrouter API key configured in .env.

```bash
npm run start:agent "Your prompt here"

# Example:
npm run start:agent "Use the echo tool to say hello world and then get a cat fact."
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Server Configuration (Environment Variables)

Configure the MCP server's behavior using these environment variables:

| Variable              | Description                                                                               | Default                                |

### Client & Agent Configuration

The agent uses the MCP client to connect to servers. This is configured in `src/mcp-client/client-config/mcp-config.json`. You must list all MCP servers the agent should connect to in this file.

For a detailed guide, see the [Client Configuration README](src/mcp-client/client-config/README.md).

## 🏗️ Project Structure

- **`src/agent/`**: Contains the core agent framework, including the `Agent` class and a CLI for running the agent.
- **`src/mcp-client/`**: Implements the MCP client logic for connecting to and interacting with external MCP servers.
- **`src/mcp-server/`**: Contains the MCP server implementation, including example tools, resources, and transport handlers.
- **`src/config/`**: Handles loading and validation of environment variables and application configuration.
- **`src/services/`**: Provides reusable modules for integrating with external services (DuckDB, OpenRouter).
- **`src/types-global/`**: Defines shared TypeScript interfaces and type definitions.
- **`src/utils/`**: A collection of core utilities (logging, error handling, security, etc.).
- **`src/index.ts`**: The main entry point for the application, responsible for initializing and starting the MCP server.

**Explore the full structure yourself:**

See the current file tree in [docs/tree.md](docs/tree.md) or generate it dynamically:

```bash
npm run tree
```

## 🧩 Extending the System

### Adding Tools to the Server

For detailed guidance on how to add your own custom Tools and Resources to the MCP server, please see the [Server Extension Guide](src/mcp-server/README.md).

### Modifying the Agent

The agent's core logic is in `src/agent/agent-core/agent.ts`. You can modify its system prompt, the models it uses (`google/gemini-2.5-flash` by default), and its decision-making loop to change its behavior.
